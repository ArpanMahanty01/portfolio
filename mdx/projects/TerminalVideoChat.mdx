# Rust Terminal Video Chat Application

In this project, I've developed a simple yet powerful terminal-based video chat application using the Rust programming language. This application allows users to establish video calls directly from their command line interface.

## Project Overview

### Features

- **Terminal Interface:** The application provides a user-friendly interface in the terminal, allowing users to initiate and join video calls seamlessly.

- **Video Streaming:** Leveraging Rust's capabilities, the application streams video data efficiently, providing a smooth and real-time video chat experience.

- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** The video chat application is built on a peer-to-peer communication model, ensuring direct and secure connections between users.

### Technologies Used

- **Rust:** The core of the application is written in Rust, taking advantage of its performance, safety, and concurrency features.

- **WebRTC:** The Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) technology is employed for video streaming, enabling efficient peer-to-peer communication.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-video-chat.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd rust-video-chat
    ```

3. Build and run the application:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

This will launch the terminal video chat application, and you can start exploring its features.
